# Links management

Overview

This project is a web application for managing links. It consists of a backend server built with Adonis.js and a frontend app built with React.js.

Backend
The backend server is built with Adonis.js, a Node.js web framework. It provides a RESTful API for managing links, including creating, reading, updating, and deleting links.

Frontend
